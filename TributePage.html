                                    <p class="lead"><b>Elias Lönnrot</b> was born in <em>Sammatti</em>, in the province of <em>Uusimaa</em>, <em>Finland</em>, which was then part of Sweden. He studied medicine at the Academy of Turku.</p>
                                    <p class="lead">Lönnrot was a Finnish physician, philologist and collector of traditional Finnish oral poetry. He is best known for compiling Kalevala, the national epic of Finland, from national folk tales that he gathered during several
                                        expeditions in Finland, Russian Karelia, the Kola Peninsula and Baltic countries.</p>

                                    <h3 class="text-center"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></i>&nbsp;<b><ins>Medical career</ins></b></h3>
                                    <p>Lönnrot got a job as district doctor of Kajaani in Eastern Finland during a time of famine and pestilence in the district. The famine had prompted the previous doctor to resign, making it possible for a very young doctor
                                        to get such a position. Several consecutive years of crop failure resulted in losses of population and livestock. In addition, lack of a hospital further complicated Lönnrot's work. He was the sole doctor for <em>4,000</em>                                    or so people, most of whom lived in small rural communities scattered across the district.</p>
                                    <p>As physicians and novel drugs were expensive at the time, most people relied on their village healers and locally available remedies. Lönnrot himself was keen on traditional remedies and also administered them. However,
                                        he believed strongly that preventive measures such as good hygiene, breastfeeding babies and vaccines were the most effective cures for most of his patients.</p>

                                    <p>His true passion lay in his native Finnish language. He began writing about the early Finnish language in <em>1827</em> and began collecting folk tales from rural people about that time. In <em>1831</em>, the Finnish Literature
                                        Society was founded, and Lönnrot, being one of the founder members, received financial support from the society for his collecting efforts.</p>
                                    <p>Lönnrot went on extended leaves of absence from his doctor's office; he toured the countryside of Finland, Sapmi (Lapland), and nearby portions of Russian Karelia. This led to a series of books:</p>

                                        <li><b>1829–1831</b> - Kantele (the kantele is a Finnish traditional instrument);</li>
                                        <li><b>1835–1836</b> - Kalevala (the "old" Kalevala);</li>
                                        <li><b>1840</b> - Kanteletar;</li>
                                        <li><b>1842</b> - Sananlaskuja, (Proverbs);</li>
                                        <li><b>1849</b> - Kalevala (the "new" Kalevala.)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Lönnrot was recognised for his part in preserving Finland's oral traditions by appointment to the Chair of Finnish Literature at the University of Helsinki in 1853.</p>
                                    <p>He also undertook the task of compiling the first Finnish-Swedish dictionary (Finsk-Svenskt lexikon, 1866–1880).</p>

                                    <p>Botanists remember him for writing the first Finnish-language Flora Fennica – Suomen Kasvisto in 1860; in its day it was famed throughout Scandinavia, as it was among the very first common-language scientific texts. The
                                        second, expanded version was co-authored by Th. Saelan and published in 1866. The Flora Fennica was the first scientific work published in Finnish (instead of Latin). In addition, Lönnrot's Flora Fennica includes many
                                        notes on plant uses in between descriptions of flower and leaf.</p>
                                    <p>The standard author abbreviation Lönnrot is used to indicate this individual as the author when citing a botanical name.</p>
